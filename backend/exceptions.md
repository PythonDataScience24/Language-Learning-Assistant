# Handling Test Failure

## Scenario: User Login with Incorrect Password

### Steps to Handle the Failure:

1. **Identify the Issue**: 
   - Check the test output to verify the status code and error message returned by the server.

2. **Review the Test Code**: 
   - Ensure that the test case correctly simulates the failure scenario by providing incorrect credentials.

3. **Check the Implementation**: 
   - Verify the authentication logic in the `auth_ns` namespace to ensure that the password verification and error handling are correctly implemented.

4. **Debug the Application**:
   - Use debugging tools or print statements to trace the flow of the login process and identify where the mismatch occurs.

5. **Fix the Issue**:
   - Correct the password verification logic if there is a bug.
   - Ensure the error messages are informative and correctly returned to the client.

6. **Re-run the Tests**:
   - After making the necessary fixes, re-run the test suite to ensure that the issue is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
